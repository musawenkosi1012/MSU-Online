Verification
We verified the implementation using a comprehensive script 
verify_tutor_flow.py
 which tested the entire workflow:

Tutor Login: Successfully authenticated as tutor@edu.com.
Course Creation: Created a test course via API.
Material Upload: Uploaded a URL resource (Wiki Tech) and verified title handling.
Question Creation: Added a test MCQ question to the bank.
Student Access: Authenticated as student@msu.edu, retrieved the repository, and generated a randomized exam containing the new question.
AI Chat: Verified that the AI can answer questions based on the course context (pending model load time).
